  "0_Atelectasis": [
    "Chest radiograph shows focal volume loss with crowding of bronchovascular markings, compatible with atelectasis.",
    "Frontal view demonstrates linear/plate-like opacity with fissural shift or mild hemidiaphragm elevation suggesting lobar or segmental collapse.",
    "There may be mild ipsilateral mediastinal or tracheal shift with hilar displacement, supporting a diagnosis of atelectasis."
  ],
  "1_Cardiomegaly": [
    "Posteroanterior chest radiograph shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette with an increased cardiothoracic ratio, suggestive of cardiomegaly.",
    "The cardiac borders are globally prominent and widened, sometimes with prominent pulmonary vasculature consistent with cardiac enlargement.",
    "After excluding projectional factors, the heart occupies an abnormally large transverse thoracic diameter, compatible with cardiomegaly."
  ],
  "2_Consolidation": [
    "A focal or lobar homogeneous air-space opacity is present, consistent with consolidation (alveolar filling).",
    "Air bronchograms may be visible within the dense region, indicating patent bronchi surrounded by alveolar opacification.",
    "The opacity can respect lobar boundaries with a silhouette sign against adjacent structures, supporting consolidation."
  ],
  "3_Edema": [
    "Bilateral perihilar fluffy opacities with a 'bat-wing' distribution are seen, compatible with pulmonary edema.",
    "Interstitial edema features such as Kerley B lines, peribronchial cuffing, and vascular blurring may be present.",
    "Upper-lobe vascular redistribution and associated pleural effusions or cardiomegaly further support cardiogenic edema."
  ],
  "4_EnlargedCardiomediastinum": [
    "The cardiomediastinal silhouette is widened or enlarged, consistent with an enlarged cardiomediastinum.",
    "Upper mediastinal widening with outward displacement of mediastinal contours and possible tracheal deviation can be seen.",
    "After accounting for positioning and inspiratory effort, the overall cardiomediastinal contour remains enlarged."
  ],
  "5_Fracture": [
    "There is cortical discontinuity or a step-off deformity in the rib or clavicle, consistent with fracture.",
    "The fracture may show displacement or angulation with adjacent soft-tissue swelling.",
    "Subtle fractures can appear as a thin lucent line and may require additional views or careful magnified inspection."
  ],
  "6_LungLesion": [
    "A focal pulmonary lesion is present, appearing as a nodule or mass-like opacity distinct from surrounding lung markings.",
    "Margins may be lobulated, spiculated, or associated with cavitation or calcification, warranting CT characterization.",
    "A solitary or multiple focal lesions with adjacent distortion or surrounding change can reflect neoplasm, granuloma, or infection."
  ],
  "7_LungOpacity": [
    "A non-specific increased pulmonary opacity is present, which may be patchy, hazy, or diffusely distributed.",
    "There can be reduced lucency and partial obscuration of vascular markings without features sufficient to specify the etiology.",
    "When opacities are multifocal or bilateral, clinical correlation and follow-up imaging or CT are recommended to clarify the cause."
  ],
  "8_PleuralEffusion": [
    "Blunting of the costophrenic angle with a meniscus-shaped opacity is seen, consistent with pleural effusion.",
    "Large effusions can cause homogeneous lower hemithorax opacity with mass effect and possible contralateral mediastinal shift.",
    "On supine films, diffuse increased hemithorax density with subtle layering and obscured diaphragmatic margins may suggest effusion."
  ],
  "9_PleuralOther": [
    "Pleural thickening is present as a peripheral linear opacity along the chest wall or an apical pleural cap.",
    "Pleural plaques or calcifications may appear as focal high-density pleural-based opacities, compatible with chronic pleural disease.",
    "Pleural adhesions can produce localized distortion or traction changes, representing non-effusion pleural abnormalities."
  ],
  "10_Pneumonia": [
    "A new patchy or lobar air-space opacity is present, sometimes with air bronchograms, suggesting pneumonia.",
    "Opacities are often ill-defined and may be multifocal with associated interstitial prominence, consistent with infection/inflammation.",
    "A silhouette sign (e.g., loss of a heart border) and interval change on follow-up imaging further support pneumonia."
  ],
  "11_Pneumothorax": [
    "A visible visceral pleural line with absence of peripheral lung markings indicates pneumothorax.",
    "On supine radiographs, a deep sulcus sign may be present, manifested by an abnormally deep and lucent costophrenic angle.",
    "In tension pneumothorax, mediastinal shift, diaphragmatic depression, and lung collapse can be seen and require urgent attention."

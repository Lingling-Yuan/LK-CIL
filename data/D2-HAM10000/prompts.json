    "Dermoscopy shows a scaly erythematous lesion with a “strawberry pattern,” including follicular openings with surrounding white halos and a red pseudonetwork, suggestive of AKIEC (actinic keratosis/Bowen’s disease).",
    "Image demonstrates an ill-defined pink to red-brown patch/plaque with surface hyperkeratosis and scattered dotted or short linear vessels, consistent with keratinocytic intraepidermal atypia.",
    "Dermoscopy reveals yellow-white scale and keratin plugs on a pink-red background, sometimes with focal erosion or crusting, compatible with AKIEC-related changes."
  ],
  "1_bcc": [
    "Dermoscopy shows a pearly, translucent papule/nodule with arborizing telangiectasia and focal ulceration or crusting, characteristic of basal cell carcinoma.",
    "Image demonstrates blue-gray ovoid nests and/or leaf-like areas with shiny white structures and prominent telangiectatic vessels, supporting the diagnosis of BCC.",
    "Lesion appears glossy pink or waxy with blue-gray dots/globules and vascular proliferation on dermoscopy, typical of pigmented or mixed-pattern BCC."
  ],
  "2_bkl": [
    "Dermoscopy shows a sharply demarcated tan-to-dark brown plaque with fissures and ridges (cerebriform pattern) and keratin-filled openings, typical of benign keratosis-like lesions.",
    "Image demonstrates multiple milia-like cysts and comedo-like openings on a relatively uniform background, consistent with seborrheic keratosis–type changes.",
    "Lesion presents as a light brown patch with mottled pigmentation and a pseudonetwork with mild surface keratosis, commonly seen in solar lentigines or related benign keratoses."
  ],
  "3_df": [
    "Dermoscopy shows a classic dermatofibroma pattern with a central white scar-like area surrounded by a delicate peripheral pigment network.",
    "Image demonstrates a symmetric brownish lesion with a pale or whitish center and fine reticular pigmentation at the periphery, compatible with dermatofibroma.",
    "Dermoscopy reveals predominant white structures with limited peripheral brown pigmentation and overall architectural stability, supporting a benign fibrohistiocytic lesion."
  ],
  "4_mel": [
    "Dermoscopy shows marked asymmetry and polychromia (brown/black/gray/blue-white) with an atypical pigment network, irregular dots/globules, and peripheral streaks, suspicious for melanoma.",
    "Image demonstrates disorganized structures with blue-white veil and/or regression features (white scar-like areas with gray dots), suggestive of malignant melanocytic proliferation.",
    "Lesion exhibits irregular borders and abrupt color variation with atypical vascular structures and irregular pseudopods or streaks on dermoscopy, consistent with melanoma."
  ],
  "5_nv": [
    "Dermoscopy shows a symmetric lesion with a uniform pigment network or homogeneous brown coloration and smooth, regular borders, consistent with a melanocytic nevus.",
    "Image demonstrates a regular globular pattern or concentric structures with minimal color variability and preserved symmetry, typical of benign nevi.",
    "Dermoscopy reveals a stable pattern with structured reticular or homogeneous areas and no prominent multicolor or chaotic architecture, supporting a benign nevus."
  ],
  "6_vasc": [
    "Dermoscopy shows clustered red to violaceous lacunae separated by pale septa, a classic feature of vascular lesions such as angiomas or angiokeratomas.",
    "Image demonstrates dark red to black-red rounded clods with possible overlying keratosis or crust, compatible with angiokeratoma or hemorrhagic change; partial blanching may be seen with pressure.",
    "Lesion appears as a bright red papule/nodule that may bleed easily; dermoscopy shows a homogeneous red area with a peripheral white collarette, suggestive of pyogenic granuloma or vascular proliferation."
